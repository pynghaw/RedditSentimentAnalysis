1lcwoxq,Danny Boyle Here: Ask Me Anything.,my3oemn,"It's been 18 years since *28 Weeks Later* came out and development for a third film stalled for such a long time but then suddenly we're not only finally getting a sequel but an entire *28 Years Later Trilogy* that's being fast-tracked with *The Bone Temple* already filming before *28 Years Later* has even come out.

What about these upcoming movies spurred you and Alex Garland to ""seriously"" and ""diligently"" see them enter production as quickly as possible? Especially in this age where so many zombie media and stories have already come out? Was the vision for the story something you & Alex always had in mind but just needed time to flesh out or was the pitch cracked just somewhat recently?",235,1750090161.0

How much does listening to music influence your creative process (if at all)? From “Born Slippy” to “In The House, In a Heartbeat”, you have created some iconic climaxes that work beautifully with the  exogenic music that you selected. 
Does the music serve as a starting point for your visualization/storytelling? Is it the other way around? Is it both?

I thought '28 Days Later' was great and am really looking forward to '28 Years Later'.

I did want to ask the extent to which the international implications of the virus were considered during production.

I know that the whole premise is that the virus is UK-centric, but cutting off an entire country, especially one as large and reliable as the UK, would have a grand impact on global affairs and development, and I'm curious to see how society would evolve without the UK for nearly three decades.

Despite 'Years' being set in a mostly enclosed space, to what extent were these ideas considered?

I revisit it often and my love for it has only grown with time. The script, the VFX that still look incredible today, the amazing cast and acting. It’s top to bottoms perfect to me. And that casting has aged like fine wine in the years since.

I was wondering, how do you feel about the continued use of ‘Adagio in D Minor’ after its use in the Sunshine?

For me the piece fits the movie perfectly but in the years since, it’s been used a lot in other movies, trailers, tv shows and adverts.

I feel it’s now been overused as generic ‘epic sounding music’ that has somewhat diminished the.. ‘specialness’ of the piece, for lack of a better word. When I see it used in an advert it feels like an expertly crafted bowl of fine china being used to store your kids skittles.",5,1750093233.0

Mr. Boyle, how do you decide which projects to work on/direct on?

I ask because your directed projects vary not only in the wide ranges of genre, but in cinematography and audio approach. I also ask because 28 days later is arguably the most zombie genre defining film of our century and forgive me for saying something so simple minded, but I would’ve interpreted the success of that film as a gift for horror and would have went all in on the genre! Only you didn’t, and would instead give us a variety of other stellar projects, my personal favorites being these character films like Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours, and ONLY recently did you decide to return with 28 Years Later!

My favourite scene you’ve ever done is the second time we see Renton and Spud running down Princes Street to Blur - Sing.

It’s identical to the first scene backed by a Lust for Life but the fucking sorrow and desperation on their face is incredible. 

It’s the same footage I think but the context has utterly changed, and it’s so beguiling, beautiful. I love it from an emotional perspective but from a filmmaking perspective.

Can you speak to this?  It seems so incredible time consuming to seek this out.  Considering the budget and time constraints, I can easily imagine either someone trying to dissuade you from this extra effort - or perhaps even second guessing yourself on it.

I’m absolutely stoked to watch 28 Years Later this weekend! I’ve probably seen 28 Days Later over 28 times by now, it’s just one of those films that pulls you back in repeatedly, thanks to the incredible atmosphere it creates. 

I also really admire how varied your body of work is. Films like Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, T2, Sunshine, and Slumdog Millionaire have all left such a lasting impression on me.

My question is actually related to Slumdog Millionaire. I’ve had discussions with friends about whether to consider it more of a “British” or “Indian” film. From interviews, I know you’ve mentioned bringing only a handful of crew from the UK and relying heavily on local film crews and expertise in India. In that sense, the film seems to straddle both identities.

Based on your experiences filming Slumdog Millionaire in India and its subsequent success, would you ever consider working on another ""foreign language film project"" in a similar vein? If so, are there specific countries or cultures that particularly interest you as a filmmaker?

Love these insights. 

When I first read movie scripts, I didn't know those things and I thought screenwriting was so bare and stripped-down compared to normal narrative writing in novels that I was used to. 

Now I know better and that's by design. The simple writing is so the actors, director, cinematographer, production designer et al have room for interpretation to apply their creative input.

This didn’t feel very scary to me. It was creepy at some points but it didn’t scare me as much as 28 Days Later and even some points of Weeks did.

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqnox2,"Overall, well worth the wait. Two things that deserve a shoutout: Alfie Williams as Spike and the overall cinematography/editing.

My personal nitpicks: I'm not sure if it was my theater, but the sound mixing seemed off? I'm not sure if it was intentional, but the most noticeable for me was between Spike's party and the shed being on fire. I'm not talking the dial up/internet sounds, overall mixing and quality on voices was all over the place.

The alpha chase scene to end act 1 (across the land bridge), the water was noticeably CGI. From a visual standpoint, the ariel splashing shots to show the alpha closing in was tense but I was getting video game graphics from the water.

Some more highlights: The infected looked great, both the normal fast ones, but also the new slow ones.

The soundtrack was great. The Boots poem fit well within the movie.

Story wise, Spike's motivation to get to the doctor on the mainland was just enough to sell me on it. Not as far fetched as the kids from 28 Weeks Later going back to their home, Spike's motivation was clear... I am being lied to, specifically by my dad.

The Swedish soldier's girlfriend scene was a good break and humorous.",1,1750385066.0

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqn7y5,"Overall, I thought it was a very interesting follow-up to the previous two films, with this one probably being my second favorite behind 28 Days, but definitely a lot weirder than I expected lol. First, I love how through the cinematography and visual effects & how it created a surreal atmosphere, it felt like Spike and his family were living in a total nightmare/fever dream, even with the beautiful shots of Spike and his parents walking through the countryside (which reminded me of some of the shots of the Shimmer in Annihilation) & the glimpses of the oasis that's the island community they live in (specifically the scene where everyone celebrated Spike's first trip to the mainland, which was shot to make them like a little crazy in some way in my view).

The gore delivered as well, especially with the way the Alpha infected can easily manhandle and behead humans, which fit with them looking like Roman Reigns/Jason Momoa, and it was really creepy to see how those infected move in a similar way to a normal human compared to the rest of their groups (along with the way the bloated infected on the ground moved combined with the visuals of them eating worms, which made look like completely different beasts compared to the other types of Infected). Additionally, their cries (particularly the childbirth scene) felt haunting because of how it makes it feel like the infected still have their normal human selves trapped deep within them, similar to TLOU's infected.

Aaron-Taylor Johnson was great, and after seeing how encouraging he seemed with guiding Spike along on his first mainland journey, it felt really deflating to see his character's worst side as a personality with him cheating on Isla while she was ill & him hitting Spike. Jodie Comer really came alive in her performance as Isla once her character went on a trek to the mainland with Spike, especially in the scenes where she regained her lucidity to either protect him from Infected (which makes me want to imagine how formidable she was with Jamie pre-cancer) or when she helped the infected woman give birth. Speaking of that last part, I really want to know if/how the seemingly non-infected babies of infected adults will grow up to stay non-infected or be carriers with no visible symptoms like Andy & Alice from 28 Weeks, and if they'll still be individually targeted by the grown Infected.

Regarding Alfie Williams's performance as Spike , during the scene where he created a distraction for the other guards to leave the island with Isla, I initially thought I was going to hate him in a similar way as Tammy and Andy, but I grew to like his evolution into a hardened survivor by the final act of the film. & Ralph Fiennes was great in his performance as a survivor who's still seems a bit insane, but actually very benevolent & selfless (with some moments of humor like when he greeted the Alpha as Samson after subduing him). With Ralph's performance, particularly the aspects of him embracing death and him pushing that into Spike's mind when Isla is ready to die, I think he really embodied the film's feeling of both bleakness & a sense of gratitude/beauty for simply still being able to survive another day, even through the horrors of the outbreak.

Even with all of those performances, I want to single out Edvin Ryding's performance as Erik (the Swedish soldier who survived the longest out of his squad) as a particular favorite of mine, because even with his short screentime, he had a older sibling/younger sibling dynamic with Spike, particularly during the hilarious scene of him showing Spike a smartphone (& the way he talked to him in general with mentioning the outside world while Spike didn't understand any of it lmao) and their banter over how Erik's fiance looks lol, & it was heartbreaking to see him have a brutal death at the hands of an Alpha infected.

The final scene with Jack O'Connell and his group saving Spike caught me off-guard with how goofy it looked compared to the rest of the film that I laughed hard during that entire sequence & other people at my showing were like ""WTF?"" lol. It was pretty interesting, but I can also understand why others might hate this tonal shift. I immediately assumed that the campiness of this ending has to be an overt tribute to George Romero's comedic elements in his zombie films. I heard some talk about how the character of Jimmy might be a nod to Jimmy Savile, but since I don't know a lot about him as an American myself, I got the initial impression that him & his group just looked like a bunch of Ali G cosplayers who picked up their survival skills from watching 70s/80s martial arts films lmao. But knowing the controversy behind Savile, if his character really is influenced by him, then The Bone Temple is going to take a really dark turn.

On a side note, knowing how drastic the Infected have evolved, I wonder if the next two films will keep the outbreak confined to the UK, or if there's still a chance it'll spread beyond it (or the possibility of a look into survivors struggling to integrate into the outside world devoid of the virus & normal life by the end of the story after all the horrors of the sequels or mistrust between survivors & more outside troops who find themselves in the mainland).",1,1750384901.0
1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqpui7,"28 Years Later is not a 'zombie' flick. It's not really a pure horror film either. It's a coming-of-age family drama set against a post-apoc backdrop, with horror elements sprinkled throughout and a distinctly British flavour. 
  
Overall I enjoyed it. I credit this in-part because I read the (spoiler free) reviews ahead of time and so I knew this was more drama focused and less emphasis on the infected. If you go into this expecting a 2-hour version of the '28 Weeks' opening scene, you will probably be disappointed. If you watched '28 Days' mainly for the scenes with the infected, you will probably be disappointed. If you're only knowledge of the series is the 'Boots' trailer, you'll probably be disappointed.
  
I liked the hints at a wider world operating in the ruined UK, and it was fun watching Spike learn about this new, dangerous world that's been at his doorstep but off-limits his whole life. I also emphasized with the young boy learning that his parents aren't perfect, and have their own flaws as humans. Light spoiler: >!If you have a family member who is/had dealt with declining health, you'll probably feel a stronger connection with what Isla is going through.!<
  
That ending though... It's gonna be talked about for *years*. I think we will need to revisit this after The Bone Temple comes out next year. It could either make that ending all-time brilliant, or totally fall flat to potential film-ruining scale. Definitely a big swing by the filmmakers. Excited to see what they do with it.

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqn9ti,"Damn, I loved this movie. Everything about it was hitting with me. The music, the performances, the visuals, the story, I never knew where this movie was going and I loved where it ended up. Nasty, satisfying kills but also a deep rumination on not just understanding death in a world where it is so commonplace, but also on the failings of isolationism and the dangers of losing hope. I had no idea I'd love this so much but it shot right up into my top three Boyle films, a filmmaker I really like. 

First thing, this movie is absolutely beautiful to look it. It's got thay Boyle kinetic energy to it and his colors are always so striking and vivid. The big landscape shots of the island, the bone temple itself, the starry night sky as they're being chased back to the island. Not to mention those 20 iPhone kill shots, cutting to different angles in real time. Absolutely stunning film, I couldn't take my eyes off it. 

I fear a lot of people will go in expecting pure brutality and zombie fun and be kind of confused on how emotional this movie gets, but it absolutely worked for me. I see this movie as two parts, one journey with Spike's father, and one journey with his mother and the differences between them. He teaches Spike how to kill. The journey with his mother, though, teaches Spike the necessity of that death. She helps bring life into the world and I think that's just as profound a moment for Spike as his first kill is. This world requires that balance, you can't just go kill everything you see and drink yourself to death after, you have to offer something to the world as well. 

The performances in this are all really top tier. Comer is so damn good in this movie, when she's explaining to the doctor her waves of confusion I was in absolute shambles. Her and Fiennes are so damn good in this, they really sell the climax of this movie being emotional rather than action oriented. The main Alpha villain is really no more than a nuisance for the third act, the film very purposely is not focusing on that. Fiennes stays winning in roles like this, he's so funny but so real. His importance is teaching Spike to respect the dead, all the dead. Not to mention Spike himself, absolutely the focus of the movie and he is keeping pace with these absolute pros. 

Danny said something interesting in his AMA about how this has a lot to do with COVID and Brexit isolationist feelings and I really felt all that. It's kind of an argument against hiding away and just surviving when things are bad in the world. At the end Spike decides to go out into the world, not necessarily to make it better but because he doesn't want to become his father. His dad is so mad at the end because Spike has dropped off this baby and therefore forced him to care for another thing, to have some hope for a future. He was waiting for his wife to die and rushing his kid to be an adult so he could be free from expectation, but Spike forces him to have some responsibility and hope. 

Overall, like with most Garland projects, I just found there to be so much to chew on. And with Danny's energy and style and incredible ear for music (I haven't even mentioned the music, it's so damn good, has a great modern punk feel) this ended up being one of my favorite movies of the year. 9/10.",1,1750384920.0

* The climax of the film not being horror or even action but emotional. To be clear, I liked what we got, but I wanted so many more scares and so much more tension  


* Okay, I understand kids are stupid. But the whole fucking plot is this kid being very, *very* stupid. After the first act where he barely survived by having his much experienced father with him, he not only tries to conquer the mainland himself, but drags his fucking severely mentally ill mom with him? By the end of the fucking movie he's had to be saved by someone else, mostly by chance, like five fucking times and he thinks he can just live there indefinitely? 


* Bro, what was even the point of the Swedish zoomer soldier? He felt so fucking out of place, he was acting more like a fuckboi rich tourist than a soldier who saw his entire fucking squad brutally killed and will never see his fiance again. He was introduced as a rude, loud idiot and died (shortly after) a rude, loud idiot demanding to be allowed to shoot a baby (justified in this scenario, but still). You could have cleanly exercised all his scenes and the film would have been the exactly the same. 


* The reveal of the bone towers was such a let down. Their image in the trailer suggested so many interesting things about the “evolving” infected. Instead we find out it's some weirdo’s art project. A weirdo who is supposed to be a good guy, whose art project the movie really wants us to think is a beautiful way to remember and honor the dead… when skull piles are like the universal symbol of dehumanization and mass murder lmao. Whose “contributors” probably really wouldn't have liked being part of. The islanders were right to avoid him lmao 


* The ending. A lot of people are lot more funny and eloquent then are going to shit on the ending, so I'll leave it to them. But I will say that as someone who didn't even know they were supposed to be Jimmy Saville ninjas, I still thought the ending was the most jarring thing in a film I've ever seen. It was something out of Zombieland or Z-Nation. They were doing parkour! 


* It was hard to understand the dialogue, especially in the beginning. I didn't know if it was the accents or what. Brits, was it easier to understand? 

I know all of this makes it sound like I hated the film, but the flaws it does have are just so confusing they were stayed in my mind.

It just seemed to fall flat and each new development felt like it was going to be built on but was then replaced with another plot point that ultimately felt like a lead in to a sequel. 

  
I think the worst offense though was that apart from the initial chase scene into the run down house everything horror wise just felt goofy and artificial, nothing was really scary.

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqpt5h,"I really liked the first half of this movie.  Weirdly, I feel like there's a theme of toxic masculinity.  As Spike and Jamie walk to the mainland, the intercutting of the creepy poem ""Boots,"" with the men marching and fighting various wars, sets them up as these masculine heroes.  But ""Boots"" itself is about how soldiers go mad from the ""manly"" thing they do.  

On the mainland, Jamie pushes Spike to kill the infected man hanging upside down, when Spike doesn't want to.  

And back at home, there's an emphasis on women preparing the party for Spike's return.  Jamie, obviously, lies about what he and his son did, to make Spike seem more heroic, but all he's doing is perpetuating a lie.  

At Spike's party, we learn Jamie's a cheat; he is truly a badass out in the field who keeps him and his son alive, and obviously his wife isn't all there, but it still isn't moral or badass to cheat.  And at the party, people celebrate Jamie's manly deeds, and push drinks on him, which he just vomits up.

All the iconography of the English flag and Queen Elizabeth, it's like the people on the island are happily complacent, continuing society as they knew it, and upholding old standards of society that are ultimately harmful.

The island village had cult vibes that were never explored well.


As someone who had cared for a terminally-ill family member, Isla's journey hit home. Yes Spike is stupid for chasing the doctor with her in zombie territory, but that's the exact feeling I got on some days juggling the morphine. That feeling of ""I'm in over my head but I have no choice."" 


Also thought it was interesting hat Isla helped birth a child while she herself was dying, and Jamie was so obsessed with making Spike kill while desperately wishing for his wife to die. 


Love the doctor. Just an absolute weirdo that's somehow believable. I wasn't fussed with the twist about the bones bc I've seen plenty of weird ass yard art that looks sinister but isn't.  


The Jimmy cult at the end wasn't explored and just didn't go well with the rest of the movie. I know where they come from and what they represent but the tone clash is just too much. I think John Wick did the little world-building drips better than 28 Years Later.

Overall, it betrays the tone of the first two. It's a character driven movie, but that's not what any of us were here for.

Especially not fifteen seconds after she died, especially not after knowing exactly what process this man put her body through to extract her skull. He just sort of plops her head down on the table like “here ya go!”

They establish that the skulls fall off very easily. I could not stop thinking of my mom’s skull blowing off the top of that thing and smashing within hours. I would also really hate for her skull to be piled up with all these random people’s skulls. Everything about it is mind bogglingly fucked up and the movie doesn’t at all acknowledge that reality. 

Something was tonally off about the final act of this film. Lots of it is too absurd and bizarre to ignore. Lots of strange (and quick) decision making by people who just met each other. By far the most usage of a poison dart blow gun outside of a Jonny Quest or Giligan’s Island episode. A LOT of confidence in the biological situation of that baby for no reason.

Spoilers below

28 Days later had desperate and heart-felt acting.  It was moving.  The characters were making sense of the unfolding of a new reality.  
28 years later didn’t have bad acting as much as bad writing to work with, which didn’t translate into feeling great acting.
The story arc and the tension in 28 Days later, both with the zombies and with internal human issues of morality and control were fantastic.
You would think 28 Years Later would carry on that story arc.  Not only did it not do that, it was in many ways completely removed.
- 3 different breeds of zombies, from fat slovenly white zombies that eat worms, to skinny normal zombies, to “alpha” zombies that are faster, smarter and for some reason nearly immune to killing
- excessive use of alpha decapitating with attached spinal cord.  Is that the only way they kill?
- island people going medieval while zombies go cave man 
- explosion in gas station taking out all zombies but having no affect on main characters
- main character (mother) that was beside herself about how dangerous it was to go to the mainland deciding to hold hands with a birthing zombie with the zombie joining.  Then back to crazy once we’re done with birth.
- keeping zombie baby with no issues
- doctor stating, “I don’t have medical equipment or a team to assess, but my best guess is cancer”… which went naturally to son being upset while processing heavy news (all good so far and makes sense)… which IMMEDIATELY leads to doctor shooting son with morphine blow dart to calm him (what?!?)…which goes IMMEDIATELY to mom willingly going to assisted suicide by another dart (what?!?)…which goes IMMEDIATELY to son coming out of morphine induced haze to doctor handing son mom’s skull (my wife literally started laughing out loud in the theater at the absurdity of this part)
- son, with dwindling resources that were little more than a couple arrows and a pocket knife decides to not go back to the community but instead to live in the woods under the stars with the zombies at bay
- and finally, ending sequence seriously felt like an SNL sketch… band of about 8 guys and girls, all with long blonde hair, all with track suits befitting of grandparents power walking through the mall nonchalantly go all Kill Bill with excessive and unnecessary ninja flips and grotesque killing of zombies

I can't really say I liked it. Like a lot of people have said it is tonally all over the place, especially the end. Stylistically it also takes a while to settle in too and some of the shots felt way too clean compared to others. The early kill effect when they would kill an infected with an arrow was cool the first time they did it and it felt very much like a video game but then they kept doing it and for me I found myself thinking ""ok we get it. You decided to do a cool effect but we don't need to see it for a 10th time"". Also it feels weird that this cinematic universe was still able to create smart phones but the reference and inclusion of the Swedish guy having one seemed weird, but maybe I'm just being nit picky. The infected in the first two movies were able to create a sense of panic and anxiety for me but I didn't get that in this one for whatever reason.

Thing is, I've watched the first two movies. Loved the first one. Was cool on the second one. And I don't like this one. Tonally, it feels completely different from the first two movies. It doesn't feel like a sequel but almost like a recon. It ignores the established lore of the first two movies and changes the infected into something else. They no longer die from starvation for some reason. They have sex. They have almost a society where ""alphas"" exist. While in the first two movies they were very much ""infected"" with a virus, here they feel like plain old ""monsters."" Not even zombie like. Just beasts hulking around. That change alone left a sour taste in my mouth.

But really the tone of this movie isn't grounded like the first one. It doesn't feel like action disaster pic like the second one. Instead, it feels like a fairytale. Like a story that would go along with The Green Knight or Robin Hood. I think that was what Boyle was going for with his flashes to archers. Like this is a British legend about a boy going on an epic quest....for some reason. And for that reason, he and his mother for part of the movie had the most amazing plot armor. Because how else does a woman on her deathbed with cancer somehow make it across miles and miles of infected infested lands without being taken out?

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqx2sf,"I’m aware I’m in the minority here. I loved 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later. 

This one I did not love. 

1. So with the iPhone this means the world moved on and left UK to fend for themselves? Does the rest of UK know this and they choose to live in isolation? 

2. The doctor is covered in chemicals that fend off infected but if he’s aware of an alpha surely he’s come across multiple infected. Where does he live? He’s just chilling out in the open near some bones? Also does he know about the outside world and how they are living normally? 

3. Why, when sedating the alpha, does the doctor not just kill him right then and there? Lighting him on fire or stabbing him or fucking anything. He just left him standing up for later. 

4. How does an infected get/stay pregnant to give birth to a “seemingly” healthy baby. Also she becomes more human when giving birth to allow help from a non-infected human but then regresses when the baby is born? What?

All I can hope for is that the sequels explain more and in doing so will make me love this movie in the future. Again - I’m in the minority I’m well aware so I know downvotes and negative comments are coming my way but I dunno dude I just didn’t love this movie. 🤷🏻",1,1750388449.0

I think people just wanted a complete retread of days or weeks might be a little put off, but I think in a world that has been bombarded with zombie stuff nonstop since the turn of the century you need to start thinking outside of the box.


1. I wasn't expecting to get on the train to feels town when they got to the bones and skulls. Having lost my mother in part to cancer, that really hit home. The twist of what Kelson was up to still being incredibly odd but strangely wholesome was great. Ralph and Jodie really knocked it out of the park here.


2. The village functioning as a warrior clan of sorts is an interesting dynamic to explore, I'm curious what their role will be going forward and which way Jim's character will swing.


3. It's funny imagining me telling my 5 yr old self 25+ years ago that the next time he's see the Teletubbies would be at the beginning of a zombie horror film. The infected pouring into the church was wonderfully shot.


4. The only part of this movie I was sorta spoiled on was the ending coming off as wonky for some. Actually watching it I think that's a bit overblown but can see why it wouldn't be for everybody. Perhaps it would've been better to end the film at Jim screaming at the bridge and having this as a credits scene, but I was fine with it.

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqtuuv,"I think 28 Years Later is a very good legacy sequel

- I think the first act is the strongest. Father teaching his son on how to survive the lands after civilization breaks is one of my favourite tropes
- The Boots poem with rapid intercutting and the Alpha chasing Spike and Sam at the low tide are the 2 best scenes of the movie!
- The cinematography is incredible. Some of the landscape imagery is breathtaking 
- Erik providing some comic relief and context of the rest of the world in the 2nd act after the intense 1st act 
- The action and violence is very little and spread out 
- Ralph Fiennes steals the movie for me even though he is only in the 3rd act 
- Tonally, the movie shifts a lot but I love the ending scene. Cancer still existing in that timeline and Spike not fully able to understand is emotional 
- I don't like the final scene with Jimmy and his cult. It didn't link well with the movie and I immediately thought of the biker gang in the Boba Fett miniseries.

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqyug6,"I’m honestly really surprised how well this movie is being received.  The story was weak, and there were a number of things that occurred that were just comically absurd.

Spoilers below

28 Days later had desperate and heart-felt acting.  It was moving.  The characters were making sense of the unfolding of a new reality.  
28 years later didn’t have bad acting as much as bad writing to work with, which didn’t translate into feeling great acting.
The story arc and the tension in 28 Days later, both with the zombies and with internal human issues of morality and control were fantastic.
You would think 28 Years Later would carry on that story arc.  Not only did it not do that, it was in many ways completely removed.
- 3 different breeds of zombies, from fat slovenly white zombies that eat worms, to skinny normal zombies, to “alpha” zombies that are faster, smarter and for some reason nearly immune to killing
- excessive use of alpha decapitating with attached spinal cord.  Is that the only way they kill?
- island people going medieval while zombies go cave man 
- explosion in gas station taking out all zombies but having no affect on main characters
- main character (mother) that was beside herself about how dangerous it was to go to the mainland deciding to hold hands with a birthing zombie with the zombie joining.  Then back to crazy once we’re done with birth.
- keeping zombie baby with no issues
- doctor stating, “I don’t have medical equipment or a team to assess, but my best guess is cancer”… which went naturally to son being upset while processing heavy news (all good so far and makes sense)… which IMMEDIATELY leads to doctor shooting son with morphine blow dart to calm him (what?!?)…which goes IMMEDIATELY to mom willingly going to assisted suicide by another dart (what?!?)…which goes IMMEDIATELY to son coming out of morphine induced haze to doctor handing son mom’s skull (my wife literally started laughing out loud in the theater at the absurdity of this part)
- son, with dwindling resources that were little more than a couple arrows and a pocket knife decides to not go back to the community but instead to live in the woods under the stars with the zombies at bay
- and finally, ending sequence seriously felt like an SNL sketch… band of about 8 guys and girls, all with long blonde hair, all with track suits befitting of grandparents power walking through the mall nonchalantly go all Kill Bill with excessive and unnecessary ninja flips and grotesque killing of zombies

Sure, I suppose I was engaged and entertained to a degree, and definitely got some comedic amusement, but…

Act 1: Remains the same and ends when Spike takes his mother off the island to see the doctor.

Act 2: The journey to the doctor with his mother and her death.

Act 3: Spike’s father finding him with the doctor since he knew where he wanted to take the mother, and their perilous journey back to the island, now with a baby. Perhaps the father opens up and becomes honest with his son.

The movie felt like it was missing a climax to the story. I get that it was the mother’s death and the son’s acceptance, but it didn’t feel momentous enough after what the first half of this movie was.

They set him up to be this creepy villain, but he turned out to be a compassionate person who maybe lost his mind, but is now dedicating his life to honoring the dead. Just looking at the graveyard he created, I think most people would view it as a villainous warning to outsiders that this is where you go to die. But instead we learn that it’s a tribute to all the people in there. Is it weird that he made those creepy structures out of human remains? Yes. When he talks about it and we see his process and passion towards it, is it touching? Yes. I think it’s a great concept that was executed so well. He’s not going out and killing people to add to his project, he’s taking people in that have been abandoned by the world and honoring their memory in his own version of a graveyard.

On top of that, I also like how as a doctor he knows chemicals to use for sedating the zombies and keeping them away. I imagine he just doesn’t kill in general—human or zombie—which is why he never killed that alpha, which I did find kinda frustrating.",1,1750389343.0

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqtejd,"I love post-apocalyptic stories that actually explore what it might be like to try and rebuild civilisation in the aftermath (as opposed to just rehashing a survival action story). Like Mad Max Fury Road or A Canticle For Lebowitz, I like seeing twisted versions of civilisation that grow in the aftermath of the apocalypse

So I really liked how this was almost more of a folk horror film than a zombie story. The way the village had developed its own unique rituals and stuff, like those face masks used to represent the infected in plays, like a modern day version of medieval players. And of course Raph Finnes massive art project, it’s like a mirror image of the huge Angel Of The North sculpture that they reference in the film. I’m kinda hoping the next few movies go even further into the future, so we see that the legacy of his ‘bone temple’ is

I also liked that the movie wasn’t just another reiteration of the ‘humans and the real monsters’ theme, which has been done to death. Like, the father wasn’t a total monster, the mother wasn’t a total saint, the Swedish army guy was dumb but not evil, and the doctor turned out the be benevolent. I liked that the main story was about the kid trying to save his mum - like, even in the midst of hell on earth, it’s those personal relationships that matter.

And I loved Danny Boyle’s direction. I love the raggedy look of the film, sometimes grainy, sometimes out-of-focus, sometimes subjective, sometimes remote. He changed the way he filmed different scenes to match the feeling he was trying to evoke and it worked for me. I loved the freeze frame kill shots on the zombies; nice tribute to the garish early-2000 horror era of the original.

And I love love LOVED the ending. Such a wild swing. Of course a bunch of British gangsters wannabes would use the apocalypse as a chance to live out their king fu fantasies. Way more interesting than another paramilitary group or something. Makes me jazzed for the sequel because now I have NO idea what to expect.",1,1750387096.0

1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqw0ul,"Did not like this at all. The whole sequel bait sucks so much. The opening scene is clumsy and surprisingly not awesome despite being set during the initial outbreak. I enjoyed the father and son hunting part where exciting things were happening but that’s the best the movie ever got. Mother and son plot I found uninteresting because the movie doesn’t really give us a reason to care about them. Sure it sucks that she’s dying but who is she? One monologue about a trip she took with her dad years ago is not enough character development. It was honestly funny that when the big emotional death happened they flashed back to a whopping two shots of mother and son sweet moments. That’s it? I wouldn’t have minded the usual postcard happy moments flashback before she got cancer but they couldn’t be bothered to include those.

This has turned me off so completely that I have zero interest in whatever they produce after this. I also think some of the stylistic choices were awful and ugly. Those digital zooms and nanosecond cuts were atrocious and ruined the awesome moment where father and son get chased by a zombie while running in shin-deep waters. I liked the bullet time style thing whenever an arrow hits the zombies. It was overused but I liked it. Cutting to middle ages footage of archers is film school levels of creativity. It’s not clever or interesting and the simple point it makes is something a child would think of and yet they kept cutting to this footage multiple times in the movie, basically hitting audiences in the head while screaming “DO YOU GET IT YET? DO YOU? UK SOCIETY HAS REGRESSED BACK TO THE MIDDLE AGES! DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW? HERE’S MORE SHOTS OF ARCHERS AND SHOOTING ARROWS!”

Ralph Fiennes character was stupid. He’s a freak who makes monuments out of skeletons and wraps his whole insane behavior by saying he does it to honor human life. Whatever man that shit is weird and I do not like him and who cares? This is some lame ass world building. Same with that random pregnant zombie. So zombies can get pregnant and birth normal babies. OK, and? Are they going to farm these zombie ladies and knock them up to rebuild the population? World building has to have interesting implications about the setting and this is pointless. Maybe it was just an emotional drama thing or whatever and means nothing grander but even if that was the case I still didn’t care.

Every actor here did a phenomenal job, Jodi Comer came in swinging in a way I should’ve expected. The sound design and music score was phenomenal.

I know there’s complaints about the last scene and certainly more to come, I don’t have any problems with it whatsoever. It only made me more intrigued. Plus it was nice getting Jack O’Connell in 2 horror movies back to back",1,1750387083.0
1lfsc91,Official Discussion - 28 Years Later [SPOILERS],myqub74,"I feel it's going to be unpopular to say something bad about this film so...guess I'll be the brave one. I'm still forming my thoughts so I apologize if this feels scatterbrained. 

Now I liked the film but it was a massive disappointment. So please take everything I'm about to say with the perspective that I love this director and writer. 

*ahem*

Yo this film was fucking boring. I ain't some tik tok rotted movie goer. Nah, I'm a fucking film conasisser. I've seen at least one black and white film. Yeah. I'm in that deep. 

Jokes aside, it's sort of funny that the two main horror films of the year so far are deeply rooted in their country of origin. Sinners expected its audience to know American history. Those who are not familiar with our history might miss some key details. In the same way, 28 Years Later feels deeply rooted in the UK. I felt a disconnect--albeit a very interesting disconnect--with the film's cuts to World War footage and to Knights & Kings.

 I feel there is an interesting thematic connection being made about children in this zombie-filled era being juxtaposed to the ""supposed"" honor of fighting for one's country or King. I can see where the director/writer was going with this and it's pretty interesting. Perhaps I'd like the film more if I fully understood the context behind these decisions. 

While all of this worked for me despite not having a solid grasp on the nuances, I can't say that about the ending. I felt there was a Clockwork Orange vibe with the ""Dear god, Britain's youth is corrupted."" But the ending was a case where I'm sure I'm missing something in the context of Britain......but I also hate irregardless. 

Moving on to something more stupid....I might have lied. I'm a bit tik tok rotted. I was fully engaged with the first 40 minutes. Boyle is still an amazing director. I loved all of his stylized choices with the red/black flashes of the infected. I love the feeling of desolation of the island. The editing is at its best. Boyle has finally mastered the ""shaky cam"" while still framing everything coherently. It's impressive and shows a lot of growth in an already great director. And boy. My tik tok mind loved the rush of those first few action scenes. I was fully engaged in the story and this world. 

However, once the first trip ends...the film seriously drags. I'm all for a ""peaceful apocalypse"" vibe. I just...need some meat. I can appreciate the journey of Spike in this story and I was feeling things at the end with his mother...but...is this the best version of the movie you could have showed me? I'm just watching a kid walk to a place and sometimes be troubled by zombies that I know won't kill him???

Now I must rant. I can not stand the pregnant woman trope in apocalypse film. PLEASE STOP. I don't know why for some god forsaken reason every one of these fucking films needs some monster or some lady to fucking pop out a child. ""Oh it's showing the beauty of life!"" **Shut the fuck up.** I'm rolling my eyes. The beauty of life is a fucking eye roll for me. I fucking hated this part of the film so much I thought to myself, ""Fuck auteurs, maybe Brad Pitt's World War Z wasn't so bad."" And I've read WWZ so that film lies in the pits of Tartarus in my soul. I can not emphasize how much I hate this trope. 

The fact we had to abandon such a solid plot with the father and son exploring this infected mainland just to go to, ""Uhhh you see childbirth is like amazing so even rabies pilled lady becomes sane."" I know you want me to shed a tear and contemplate on the human existence. I want a head to explode.

That's a very great way of putting it. I did have these thoughts. I just thought there might have been an extra layer with flashes of ""Knights and Kings."" I know that Knights in associated with honor and chivalry (Arthurian Legend), so I thought there might have been something more I was missing. But if I was reading too deep that's fine. It was great either way. 

>Dr. Kelsey is meant to be someone who has accepted the way things are and is adapting to the present while honoring the past; not by maintaining traditions or violence but by honoring people.

I didn't mention it but I loved how the people who worshipped or wore the cross (both in the town and the guys at the end) didn't have the humanity of Dr. Kelsey who--from what I recall--was devoid of any real religious symbols.

Zombie midwifing is just worldbuilding. if you don’t buy it fine, but that’s the world the filmmakers are showing you. 

what’s wrong w dong shots?

Mom already suspected it was cancer. she even said something like “i was hoping someone would tell you (the kid), but nobody did”. everyone in the village knew. they just didn’t have the heart to tell the kid. knowing there’s no hope for a cure and her future is a painful death, why wouldn’t you want to be euthanized given the chance? that’s the urgency for you. had she waited Kelson might have died, they would have lost the supply, all sorts of shit couldve happened. better to accept it now than later. 

Son shows a lot of emotion. you just missed it. 

Kelson doesn’t kill the Alpha bec he still sees infected as people. he says so. and he’s a doctor, so he does no harm, even if he can’t help them. 

dad is a supporting character. nothing wrong with that. if you want to see Aaron Taylor Johnson be uber hunter, just watch Kraven. 

Special forces guys are always incompetent in these movies, bec they rely too much on their guns, and bec remember this is a generation that was never exposed to the virus. this was their first experience. they did not know what to expect. 

the stakes in the movie were personal. the son wanted to save his mom, only to realize that it’s actually a journey of accepting death.

1lf7lrz,New poster for ‘Chainsaw Man: The Movie -Reze Arc’,mymnhmj,"I don't know about any other shows that did this, but there's a source material reason to do it this way for Chainsaw Man.

The manga isn't popular enough, and Fujimoto doesn't make it quickly enough, to do an indefinite weekly release like Dragon Ball or One Piece.

So, we get it as a seasonal show. But at the pace they adapted season one, there's about 1.5 seasons left of material to adapt in ""Part One"" of the manga.

Dragging it out to two seasons with filler or slowing down the pacing isn't a good option. So they're grabbing one of the arcs and turning it into a movie so that they can finish off Part One with a second TV season.

Obviously box office money is a big motivator as well. But there's a legitimate adaptation difficulty that this addresses as well.",18,1750339867.0

Reminds me of how Disney just keeps churning out these shitty live action remakes, streaming costs and commercials keep increasing, the abandonment of practical special effects. It’s just going to take one movie made with AI people can’t help but enjoy for the shift to take hold. Then it will be forced down our throats like mad. Like it or not, given the cost, ease, and capability, this will probably be the future. On a side note, I’m curious to see how independent or personal AI use will be regulated in the decades to come if movies can be made at home by anyone and these companies desperately want to maintain their position in the movie industry. Now that I think of it, I wonder if that would just compel the industry to try to steer clear of excessively making movies with AI so they can try to retain some distinct value/validity/prestige for their product.

1lfj2oi,‘Mission: Impossible’ Exit Interview: Stunt Coordinator Wade Eastwood Looks Back at a Decade with Tom Cruise,myopgxz,"Great interview! The planning and level of stress that actually goes into filming these stunts must be so crazy for everyone involved. I remember reading that Brad Bird woke up in a cold sweat one of the first days they began shooting the Burj Khalifa scene in Ghost Protocol.

I really want to see footage of this dummy they used for the early runs of the biplane sequence, hahaha—it probably didn’t even happen once, but I’m just picturing a dummy flying off repeatedly while they all take notes on What Won’t Work. The scene with the torpedoes sounds like it was pretty gnarly as well, not knowing whether Tom Cruise was acting or drowning 🙃

Also interesting that Cruise was disappointed in the underwater sequence in Rogue Nation, I agree with that honestly. For how much effort went into filming it, you’d think they would have incorporated as few cuts as possible to show he was holding his breath for as long as the script required him to. I think if they had gone with a simpler set and just kept the focus on Ethan so the audience was feeling the minutes tick by as much as he was, it could have been one of the top moments of the entire franchise.",40,1750362237.0

1lfjgfw,What’s your Opinion on Promising Young Woman?,myoxnp1,"Personally I hated it. I appreciate what it’s *trying* to do, especially with how it tricks you into thinking that a lot of the men seem like “good guys.” 

My second biggest problem with it is that the film kind of feels like a bait and switch right off the bat. You know going in that you’re watching what is ostensibly a revenge film, and we open with a scene where the protagonist lures a guy back to his apartment. It builds this tension as we know that our protagonist is playing this guy and we expect some act of violence. Except it turns out her whole MO is just… giving men a verbal dressing down. Unless we’re supposed to believe that this confrontation somehow leads to these men completely changing their ways, then the whole thing feels both toothless and pointless. And if the movie does expect us to believe that this act is having some actual impact on these men, then it’s a very naive point of view.

My *biggest* problem with the film is the entire last act. The protagonist attempts to get revenge on the men who raped her friend by posing as a stripper at a bachelor party. The result? They kill her. Our protagonist, instead of achieving any sort of agency or empowerment, literally gets the “we killed a stripper” treatment. 

Now, if the film were trying to make some kind of point about how women aren’t afforded the same level of agency as men by giving us a less satisfying ending than we’d expect from the genre, then maybe there could be something there. Except the movie seemingly wants to have its cake and eat it too. In the end, our protagonist does get her revenge posthumously, and we’re supposed to cheer as the heroic and ever-competent police show up in the end to dish out justice and save the day. It completely undercuts the film’s whole point by A) trying to make us feel like the protagonist “won” even though she was literally murdered in an act of gendered violence, and B) expecting us to suddenly believe that the justice system will actually give these men what they deserve. Isn’t the whole reason our protagonist took this mission upon herself *because* it’s so hard for women to get justice within a sexist system? Are we expected to come away from the film with the understanding that, because these men are arrested at the end, they will receive their just punishment? Come on.",54,1750364597.0

Highlights all the issues with purity culture. In almost every space, the appearance of purity is much more important than accountability, and the system will bend over backwards to help rapists get away with their violence, just to maintain the facade.

Maybe one day it'll be better to actually deliver justice than to pretend a crime hasn't happened. Personally, I'd much rather have a reputation for holding people accountable than being pure. In fact, the facade of purity just attracts predators who know how to hide behind it. The same way that authority attracts bullies, and wealth attracts grifters.

What's worse, even if she was in the right morally, she still drugged a room full of people and tried to kill a guy after spending most of the movie trying to get revenge on them.

1lfjgfw,What’s your Opinion on Promising Young Woman?,myournp,"Most regions with a significant religious population have a bad relationship with intimacy. Sex is shameful, talking about sex is taboo, thinking about it is a sin.

This is seeped into the overall population to such a degree that whether or not any individual is religious, it's baked into their cultural zeitgeist. If you see anything sexual in a space you're not expressly expecting to see it, the immediate feeling will be shock, and sometimes even disgust.

That's purity culture. And it's completely saturated into every aspect of our public lives that there's an almost ubiquitous mutual agreement to avoid the topic as much as possible.

That's why rape victims don't report their rapists. That's why institutions the rapist is a part of will vociferously protect the rapist and discredit the victim. That's why a mountain of evidence disproportionate to what's reasonable is required for judges not to summarily throw out the case. And if a judge was trying to find an excuse to not deal with it and fails, the response is almost always resentment, which leads to a hostile trial that does not have good odds for the victim.

The whole system is designed to punish the victim for making a noise, because having a confirmed rapist in a church, school, county, or state is worse to these people than the rape itself. By orders of magnitude. So, they fixate on the victim with the flawed sentiment that if the victim weren't present to begin with, the sex crime wouldn't have happened.

Of course, this is bass-ackwards; rapists gonna rape. But these people will never consider the damage they're doing; only the signal they're projecting. Purity. The sex crime didn't happen. To challenge the purity is an attack, and retaliation will ensue.

Purity culture is the ubiquitous agreement to maintain the facade of chastity. The topic of sex has specific allowed spaces, and anyone that brings it out of those spaces are punished. Especially rape victims.

Purity culture is the root of every failure and miscarriage of justice for sexual violence in real life that the whole premise of this movie is founded on.",8,1750363775.0
1lfjgfw,What’s your Opinion on Promising Young Woman?,mypgy8n,"If it were easy to tell which men are predators, women wouldn't have picked the bear. 

Not to mention that several women were just as accountable for the miscarriage of justice as the men. One school administrator helped sweep it under the rug. A wife of one of the witnesses sat on video evidence of the crime for years. 

It's not just about how sick men can be. It's about how easy it is to get away with. An ounce of privilege and the reputation of an institution will shield the worst people from the consequences of the most heinous abuses.

Churches, schools, companies, political parties. Even families. 

There's a sickness in our culture that will put reputation over accountability at all costs, and the result is a safe space for predators.",19,1750370371.0

>In Variety, Dennis Harvey praised Mulligan's performance as ""skillful, entertaining and challenging"", but questioned her casting, writing that she wore her ""pickup-bait gear like bad drag; even her long blonde hair seems a put-on"". He speculated that producer Margot Robbie may have once been intended for the role instead. Mulligan criticized the comment, saying, ""I felt like it was basically saying that I wasn't hot enough to pull off this kind of ruse ... For this film, you're going to write something that is so transparent? Now? In 2020? I just couldn't believe it."" Variety issued an apology, saying the review had been insensitive and ""minimized"" her ""daring performance"".[42] The National Society of Film Critics defended Harvey's review and criticized Variety's apology. Harvey responded to Mulligan's comments in The Guardian: ""I did not say or even mean to imply Mulligan is 'not hot enough' for the role."" He pointed out that he was a 60-year-old gay man and did not ""go around dwelling on the comparative hotnesses of young actresses"".[43]

- Frances McDormand was the most widely-nominated nominee that year. Mulligan wasn’t nominated for the BAFTA that year despite being British and starring in an acclaimed British film. It’s usually an unspoken rule that Oscars go to someone that all the big mainstream awards agree we’re good (also see Lily Gladstone).

- It’s also an unspoken rule that best picture winners usually win at least 3 awards.

I don't know what a value of purity is - but I'm pretty sure rapists still go to prisons; if by purity you mean wealthy, and their overall ability to avoid consequences for their crimes, then sure, but let's not call it purity.

I don't think anyone is looking at Mr. Ceo - his friends, neighbors: and thinking ""fuck, that guys so god damn pure, let's not touch it"" as much as they are thinking ""no one mess with the Golden Goose"".
