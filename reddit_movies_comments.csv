I’m a Japanese woman, and first of all—thank you so much for this amazing opportunity. I’d be honored to ask you a question.

I’ve always loved classic action heroes—Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jackie Chan, Tom Cruise… those legends shaped my view of action movies growing up.

But I never really imagined myself as the hero. I loved watching them, but it always felt like something far from my own world.

Then I saw your film ""Hardcore Henry"" —and for the first time, because of the immersive FPS style, I truly felt like I was the one running, fighting, and surviving. It completely changed how I experienced action on screen.

So I just wanted to ask: Did you have an action hero (or heroes) you looked up to? Someone who inspired your idea of what a hero could be?

Thanks for creating something that made me feel like I could be in the story, too.

I'm going to watch ""Heads of State"" today! Can't wait!",13,1751477694.0

I'm an enormous fan of your work, both in film and music. Hardcore Henry is my favorite action movie of all time, and to be frank, has killed the genre for me, with only a few living up to the adrenaline fueled insanity of your fps masterpiece. In a similar vein, your music video for Kolchik is my favorite music video, and the song that hits closest to home for me is One Night in 99, bringing me back to a simpler time where I'd obsessed over a single obscure piece of music. 

I say all this because you've inspired me greatly, to the point that the first fan made music video I made was a first person heist set to The World's Most Important Something, and right now I'm working on a short horror film, also in the first person. I want to ask, nearly 10 years removed from it's original release, what do you make of the legacy that movie left behind? Are you still proud of it?

Do you think that Hardcore Henry and Nobody has played a role in today's modern culture/media?

How was working with Sharlto Copley like on Heads of State after working with him on Hardcore?

You said that you have an outline for Hardcore Henry 2, do you still think about it?

Will you ever make another film festival movie?

Will there ever be another Biting Elbows concert?

You mentioned in the director's commentary of Hardcore that the rooftop finale is inspired by l4d2's ""no mercy"" campaign along with referencing other Valve titles like Half-Life (and even cs i think?). What do you have to say about Valve now? (also is the barrel that henry bumps into while driving the car before blowing up a truck with an explosive an explosive barrel from half life 2? really looks like it.)

  
Are anymore collaborations with Kojima on the table?

How do you look back on the False Alarm MV after that ""Hurry Up Tomorrow"" might be Tesfaye's last release under his stage name ""The Weeknd""?

Are you still in contact with people from your ""Biting Elbows"" era? (Valyaev, Kondratev, Dementiev, Kvataniya and more)  


Will your wife make an appearance in your media? I love her work on Hardcore.

Do you have anything to say about Garik?

I have three and a bit different questions:

I know Shorten the Longing sort of lingered in development hell, but are there any plans or small thoughts regarding a third album or at least some singles. Maybe a live album or a tribute project?

Are there any ideas regarding the self-titled / EP / singles compilation being repressed and put on vinyl?

Almost a decade ago, you spoke about Hardcore Henry not gaining enough traction to go forward with a sequel, but you did speak about a possible spiritual successor. Are there any updates regarding that, or did it mould into something else?

This final question may come across as a little personal, but are there any worries about Nobody going forward with more instalments? Such as shift in tone or jumping the gun as some franchises tend to do in its later life.",2,1751465124.0

1. I’ve put out a message looking for a drummer on a musician forum and Ilia answered. He was (and still is) ten years older than me and our guitarist at that time (Yuri Zolotarev, who quit the band but recorded and mixed our first album). In time, Ilia switched from drums to bass when we met Alexey and saw how great he was, and finally, Garik, who sadly passed away a year and a half ago, was Ilia’s longtime friend from his home town of Yaroslavl.
2. Absolutely brilliant. They’re talented, smart team players that understood what I was aiming for and gave me all the love and support a director needs to make a good movie. Professionally speaking, these last 3 years were the happiest in my career.
3. A movie that I’m very proud of is out and available across the world. I’m sitting in a cozy flat in London, which I now call my home. I’ve got nothing to complain about.
4. Tough to choose as we don’t release songs that we don’t love, but I’d have to pick Sahara as my favorite vibe wise.
5. We never really know for sure, but the bloodied man in the reflection was played by me. Since Henry was pieced back together as told by a very unreliable narrator, and possibly designed to look like the technician (also played by me) he may have been someone completely different to begin with.

I’ve done nothing not much else with my life other than watch films, action or otherwise, talk about films and occasionally play music. This means picking a favorite action hero or star is pretty much impossible, but I’ll try.

Oh Dae-su from Oldboy for the tragedy and self taught, stop at nothing drive.

I’m both, a little proud and a little nervous when I hear that my work has inspired serious choices to be made by the viewer. I wanted to make films since I was 7, but had a quick bout of wanting to be an architect when I was 13 or 14. This lasted about a week until I realized how truly complicated that job is. But it did make me think of why that felt so interesting, and the answer further cemented my desire to be a filmmaker - it’s to make something that makes people’s lives better, at least for an hour or two, and is around long after I leave.

1. I’d probably say no, except I’m very often told by random and very different people I meet how much they love one or the other, and if lucky, both of them.
2. A pleasure. He’s a great actor and a great friend. Due to the actors strike, I had 70% of the movie shot, and had 8 months before we could resume filming, so I decided to test the movie. I put together what we frontally called the hiatus cut, with a bunch of concepts and storyboards to fill in the missing gaps. I wrote an offbeat narration and needed someone very good to deliver it with a smirk and style, so I called Sharlto to help me out. The hiatus cut was really well received in the tests and so it became the Sharlto cut. When it came time to shoot the tomatina sequence, the part of Coop was originally written for me to play, but knowing how hectic that week was going to be, and my lack of acting talent, I asked Sharlto if he’d like to come down to the south of France for a few days and be in the actual film. He kindly agreed and here we are.
3. Mostly in fever dreams, but yes.
4. Sure. I may be known as an action guy, but there are so many wonderful genres that I’d love to work in.
5. There were no Half Life inspired Easter eggs in HH, except the half life poster in the stoner’s apartment.
6. I’d love to work with Hideo, he is the true definition of genius.
7. It was a great time in my life - I just completed my first film, I was in sunny LA, and Abel reached out to make FA for him. It was a lot of challenging fun, and I’m proud to have, in a small way, participated in the story that is The Weeknd.
8. Yes! Valyaev shot a few background plates in Thailand for Heads of State, where he now resides. And try Dementyev played on of the Belarusian hoodlums in the movie. We’re trying to make a film with Lado Kvataniya ( if you haven’t seen his incredible debut - The Execution, please do so right now). And Biting Elbows are still ongoing.
9. My wife was in Nobody, and has a small part in Heads Of State. She’s stopped acting and focused on her composing and directing career. She looked at what I’ve been doing and thought, hey, I could do that, and she was right.
10. Garik was a great guitarist and an even better man. We were not the greatest of friends, but we were close enough that I cannot listen to any of our music without getting watery eyed.

Your philosophy is correct, I'd say. 

Everywhere in the film world has it hard right now. Terrifyingly so. I always recommend the same thing to starting out directors: go shoot something, anything. Pump those directorial muscles up. If you don't have any money to spend, shoot no budget, shoot tiktoks, work on understanding how to tell a compelling story in short form. Make mistakes, learn from them and get good enough to get called to make something for someone. That would be the main thing to focus on. Simultaneously, look for any openings, if you can afford to go work as a PA, do so. Get as much experience on any productions that you possibly can. Don't move to a shooting hub until you have money saved up and at least a shot at getting a paid gig. It's not easy and not everyone will get that shot, but I wish you the best of luck.",8,1751514033.0

The bigger and more importantly, the better the music videos and the films get, the more likely you are to receive offers for bigger and even better projects.

Making Hardcore Henry, I knew that I'd be called upon for these straightforward action films, instead of elevated material that truly spoke to me. It took a little bit of time to start getting better scripts with more interesting actors but I did spend 2016-2021 passing on pure action extravaganzas. The kind that I really enjoy watching but don't want to spend 2.5 years of my life making. After the success of Nobody, the quality on offer rose significantly, and after Heads of State, more doors have opened up.

The honest answer is that I got very lucky when a music video I made, got seen by a ton of people worldwide, including folks in Hollywood. I got a movie deal of that, which is quite insane, and in most cases would end up in a catastrophic failure. 

I worked in tv and movies since the age of 16, and got my first paid directing gig at 25/26 and my first feature began shooting at 29. I made connections, networked, did all the other supposedly correct things, and that music video did more for me in a day than 13 years of hard work. I was also lucky in the sense that I started off in Moscow, which had way less competition than LA or NY. So when I came to LA for the first time, I was fresh but already quite experienced.

My recommendation is to shoot, shoot and shoot, until you make something that is good enough to get noticed and be given a shot. It's a tough industry that's only gotten tougher. I don't know the best way to breakthrough right now as it's constantly changing goalposts, but I do know that getting better at the craft will never be the wrong move.

I already had hardcore henry on my watchlist but that music video made me watch it immediately. I was floored.

I saw heads of state. It's such a fun movie. I liked that Edgar wright/wes Anderson style editing for flash backs. That was cool. And as usual great action. Your protagonists bickering was actually more fun that james gunns protagonists bickering. Especially since you're more aware of the limit, james gunns bickering sometimes overtays the welcome.

I'm not even gonna gush out about nobody, everyone else here already did. But I have seen that bus scene in yt atleast hundred times after the movie.

>Before Psycho came out in 1960, cinemas screened films on a loop. This was usually as a double or even triple feature. Anyone could walk into a film at the beginning, middle or end, see the next feature and then watch the parts of the first film that they missed. Many members of the audience were disorderly and disruptive. 

>Theatres were initially reluctant about such a big change. But Hitchcock was insistent. He had Paramount’s backing to promote Psycho in the way he wanted since he funded most of the film himself. At cinemas across the country loudspeakers broadcast Hitchcock declaring that no one could come in after the film started. Once the film began the cinema doors were locked. It was all part of Psycho’s marketing campaign. Even the trailers highlighted this message. One trailer urged audiences to arrive at theatres on time, another underlined the need for secrecy and the third showed Hitchcock conducting a tour of Bates’ motel: the film’s main location.",436,1751820334.0

Anyone could walk into a film at the beginning, middle or end, see the next feature and then watch the parts of the first film that they missed. Many members of the audience were disorderly and disruptive. 

That paragraph is not completely true. This topic came up on Reddit a few years ago, so I found a random newspaper from the 50s and looked at the cinema ads and many cinemas were clearly showing films at set times once a day. So if you missed the start of the film, you were shit out of luck and wouldn't see it again that day.

Cinemas varied in what they did. Maybe Psycho made it more widespread or standard, but people were already commonly showing up to see films at set times, just like they did at live theater.",163,1751823607.0

That was the last film I remember doing that with, but I'd done the same with other films before that.

***Edit***: Thanks to all for the feedback. Yes, I do know that it's inspired by Heart of Darkness. My point when talking about ""this type"" of epic movie isn't necessarily about Vietnam. For example, Oliver Stone as late as 1999 did give us a kaleidoscopic vision of football and its role and place in American society with *Any Given Sunday* (which of course does not have the same artistic value, but you get what I mean).

As they take on the challenge, the deeper they venture into the Congo(Vietnam), him and his crew, like the many before them all slowly have their mental chipped away by the harshness of the region. The people that the crew viewed as crazy or insane begin to make more sense. By the end of the journey, the captain and what is left of his crew have succumbed to the insanity.

Before that cue played, the score in _Jaws_ sort of peeked and poked around the idea of being revolutionary.

I sincerely can't think of another cue from another movie prior to 1975 that reached the heights established by those five minutes of music.  Oh, there was good music, but one could invariably pigeonhole a movie's score to its decade, just like a listener of classical music can easily identify which part of which century a piece was likely composed.

John Williams started a trend with that movie, underscored it with _Close Encounters_ and _Star Wars,_ and then suddenly every movie composer was kicking out masterpieces.

He’s one of my favorite directors, with VVitch being one of my favorite films and Lighthouse being great as well. When I heard he was doing a take on the Vikings, and the precursor story to Hamlet at that, I was very excited.


Unfortunately, great performances and visuals could not save a terrible script. None of the characters make decisions that make sense. The film focuses way more on spectacle than the more introspective and character focused films Eggers is known for. Various elements of the film are nonsensical. For example, Amleth goes through this trial to obtain this special sword, which has the power to >!not work during the day, making it objectively worse than just a normal sword!!<

1lt2u5a,Which movie completely surprised you — in a bad way?,n1nvuk5,"I was genuinely surprised how terrible Shazam: Fury of the Gods turned out. It’s honestly the worst DCEU movie for me. 

Black Adam was crap, I expected it to be though because of The Rock, his ego ruined the movie completely, Black Adam isn’t meant to be some hero, it’s the same issue as the Venom movies really, still though I found Black Adam to be a pretty dumb bad movie, Rock’s acting was cringe and bad like always, the kid was annoying, villain was forgettable, but Pierce Brosnan and Aldis Hodge’s acting was good IMO. Overall just a bad movie. 

Shazam 2 however I thought was so terrible it makes Black Adam look less awful in comparison. 

Holy hell, where do I even begin, not only did the first movie tease Mark Strong’s Sivana teaming up with Mr. Mind in the sequel, that doesn’t even happen here. Instead we get two old lady goddesses no one cares about played boringly by Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu, Levi is more insufferable to watch than ever, I don’t care what anyone says, Rachel Zegler is not a very good actress, especially when she doesn’t have her singing to cover for her lackluster acting abilities, she’s so limited in range in this, she has the same facial expression all the way through! I can’t believe people hate on Zendaya (who’s actually a good actress unlike Zegler) so much for her in Dune and Spiderman but give Zegler in this movie a pass? I don’t get it, all of the kids in the movie are dull af charisma voids and annoying, how the hell are they more bratty than they were in the first film if they are older? That Jack Dylan Grazer kid was alright in the IT movies but he’s horrible here with his overacting. Even Djimon Hounsou looked embarrassed to be in this shit! Not only that but this movie has a skittles ad in the middle of it, it has pedophilia jokes regarding Zegler’s thousand year old goddess making out with Grazer’s teen character because she’s in the form of a teen girl. Also Shazam “dies” suddenly, then Gal Gadot shows up to revive him and it’s so fucking cringe. This movie is overly juvenile and has no idea who it wants to be for, it’s too stupid for adults but also too scary for children. 

It’s the worst DCEU movie of the last few years IMO. Black Adam, Wonder Woman 1984, Aquaman 2, and The Flash all had at least one performance or sequence I liked, I liked nothing about Shazam 2.",5,1751821480.0

From what I ready, and I might be misremembering this, but The Northman was Eggers’ most expensive film at the time and because of that, he had to deal with a lot of studio involvement in the story.

However, I think The Northman does an excellent job at telling a tragic story, but you kinda have to squint your eyes a bit. 

If you watch the film from the perspective that all of Amleth’s visions are not proven to be real, but are basically just him reimagining his life, the film becomes much more tragic.

1ltgnjg,Most distracting use of sound effects you've ever heard in a movie?,n1qko1l,"Kind of off topic but I have my own fan theory about John Wick, copy pasting from myself here:

The first John Wick shows us ""real"" events exactly as they happened ""in universe"".

Every subsequent John Wick sequel shows us a version of events as told by henchmen and bad guys, so everything is dialed up to 11, like how they spoke of John in the first movie. It explains how they can have shootouts in public, how John can get hit a dozen times by cars, fall out of buildings, etc. There's a kernel of truth and the main events probably happened, but everything is super exaggerated because the narrators are making everything 10 times crazier.

This is the only way I can personally enjoy the completely over the top cartoony 4th movie which took #2 and #3 (which were already bloated and wacky) and then went overboard even more.


Specific examples:

In the 2nd one,  there probably was an actual subway fight, but it's not like they actually had a full on gunfight while walking next to commuters without anyone noticing. 

Another one: That scene in Central Park with everyone being an assassin that obeys Winston, which makes Winston seem so powerful he's borderline godlike; in reality it was probably *some* people, not literally *everyone*. 

And another one: Let's say there really was a fight in Paris on the Arc De Triomphe roundabout, but in reality John didn't get hit by seemingly 12 cars and murder 50 guys while cars just kept on driving; maybe he got bumped by 1 car, and shot a (still very respectable) 5 people.
